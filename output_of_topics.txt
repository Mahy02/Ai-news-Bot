there's been a handful of exciting things that have happened in the AI world this week so let's go ahead and break them down starting with the fact that X formerly known as Twitter updated their terms of service to include the ability to train any of your data on AI so they actually updated their terms of service under 2.1 operate improve and personalize our services to say we may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purpose outlined in this policy this article here on stack diary is making the prediction that it's some point Elon is planning on merging X Corp with xai Corp and using all of the data that it trained from Twitter in its new upcoming xai platform also this week Zoom rebranded what it was calling Zoom IQ they're now calling it The Zoom AI companion one of the most interesting things about this Zoom companion is that you'll be able to ask questions of it just like you do with chat GPT and it will reference all the conversations you've had in past Zoom conversations to answer your query in this chat says here users will be able to query the AI companion for the status of projects pulling on transcribed meetings chats whiteboards emails documents and even thirdparty apps they'll be able to ask the AI companion questions during a meeting to catch up on key points create and file support tickets and draft responses to inquiries as well as features that it was already able to do like have the AI companion summarized meetings automatically identifying action items and surfacing next steps Zoom even put out this video showing somebody asking question what has been discussed so far and the AI companion catches the person up as they join the zoom meeting so even if someone's late to the meeting they can still get caught up to date on everything that's been talked about that's something that we also recently saw Google talk about at their Cloud next event when they showed off that they were rolling out similar features with Google duet the video also showed off a handy chapters feature you can see down here at the bottom where you can jump to specific parts of the meeting a lot of these new Zoom features look pretty cool but as we've been seeing a lot of these other platforms like Google and Microsoft are also rolling out pretty much the exact same features inside of their competing products so it'll be interesting to see if Zoom can actually differentiate themselves and do something at least a little bit different from what we're starting to see Google and Microsoft roll out now probably the biggest news in the AI world this week was that the open- source Falcon 180b was launched making it the largest publicly available open-source large language model to date completely eclipsing LL 2's 70 billion parameters the capabilities of Falcon 180b sits somewhere between GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 so you're probably going to get better results and better output then you will with like the free version of chat GPT but not quite as good of results as what you'd see with something like GPT 4 inside of chat GPT it kind of Falls in between and across the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot

Yan Lao's perspective on AI: Yan Lao's belief that open-sourcing AI models can help improve them faster.



Yan Lao believes that open-sourcing AI models can help improve them faster. He compares AI to the invention of the car, stating that large language models are prone to hallucinations and have no concept of how the world works. He argues that they have not achieved human or animal intelligence and there is little evidence that they will. Lao believes that releasing AI models to the public and allowing them to be accessed and improved upon will lead to safer and more capable models.

Time's top 100 most influential people in AI: The list includes innovators, shapers, and thinkers in the AI field.



Time magazine recently released their list of the top 100 most influential people in AI. The list is divided into four categories: innovators, shapers, and thinkers. Some notable individuals mentioned include Elon Musk, Mustafa Sulliman, and Yan Lao. The list aims to recognize those who are making significant contributions to the field of AI. However, there are some omissions that some may find interesting, such as Ahmad Mustak from Stability AI. Overall, the list provides a comprehensive view of the key figures shaping the future of AI.

there's been a handful of exciting things that have happened in the AI world this week so let's go ahead and break them down starting with the fact that X formerly known as Twitter updated their terms of service to include the ability to train any of your data on AI so they actually updated their terms of service under 2.1 operate improve and personalize our services to say we may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purpose outlined in this policy this article here on stack diary is making the prediction that it's some point Elon is planning on merging X Corp with xai Corp and using all of the data that it trained from Twitter in its new upcoming xai platform also this week Zoom rebranded what it was calling Zoom IQ they're now calling it The Zoom AI companion one of the most interesting things about this Zoom companion is that you'll be able to ask questions of it just like you do with chat GPT and it will reference all the conversations you've had in past Zoom conversations to answer your query in this chat says here users will be able to query the AI companion for the status of projects pulling on transcribed meetings chats whiteboards emails documents and even thirdparty apps they'll be able to ask the AI companion questions during a meeting to catch up on key points create and file support tickets and draft responses to inquiries as well as features that it was already able to do like have the AI companion summarized meetings automatically identifying action items and surfacing next steps Zoom even put out this video showing somebody asking question what has been discussed so far and the AI companion catches the person up as they join the zoom meeting so even if someone's late to the meeting they can still get caught up to date on everything that's been talked about that's something that we also recently saw Google talk about at their Cloud next event when they showed off that they were rolling out similar features with Google duet the video also showed off a handy chapters feature you can see down here at the bottom where you can jump to specific parts of the meeting a lot of these new Zoom features look pretty cool but as we've been seeing a lot of these other platforms like Google and Microsoft are also rolling out pretty much the exact same features inside of their competing products so it'll be interesting to see if Zoom can actually differentiate themselves and do something at least a little bit different from what we're starting to see Google and Microsoft roll out now probably the biggest news in the AI world this week was that the open- source Falcon 180b was launched making it the largest publicly available open-source large language model to date completely eclipsing LL 2's 70 billion parameters the capabilities of Falcon 180b sits somewhere between GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 so you're probably going to get better results and better output then you will with like the free version of chat GPT but not quite as good of results as what you'd see with something like GPT 4 inside of chat GPT it kind of Falls in between and across the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot

of lagging behind in the AI world everything seems to be all about Microsoft and Google and open Ai and Elon Musk and all of that kind of stuff but according to reports apple is actually spending millions of dollars a day on training AI Apple actually believes that Ajax its most advanced language model is more powerful than chat GPT right now Apple's AI team has around 16 members including several former Google Engineers this all comes from an article from the information and they claim that a visual intelligence unit is developing an image generation model and another group is researching multimodal AI which can recognize and produce images or video as well as text now these are all just reports this isn't anything specifically announced by Apple but we definitely shouldn't count Apple out of the AI race they are definitely doing a ton of crazy AI stuff behind the scenes so this is pretty interesting it's actually called Amazon one and it's a tool where you it actually scans your hand and it can use it for payments and loyalty cards and entry access and various ways to identify you by your palm and they actually use generative AI to train this in fact they created a whole bunch of synthetic hands using Ai and trained it on these synthetic hands to help better recognize real hands and supposedly it's more accurate than scanning your retinas the idea being that in the future if you want to pay with credit cards you need to show identification you want to access entry to a concert or something like that you no longer need to scan your phone or a ticket you just wave your palm over a sensor and it knows that you're you and you're supposed to be there this week an article came out in Time Magazine all about Elon musk's struggle for the future of AI now it's quite a hefty read but basically it sort of breaks down elon's history with AI it talks about how he's been deeply concerned about about the risks of uncontrolled Ai and how he actually had arguments with Larry pagee who called him a species for wanting to Value lives of humans over potential consciousness of computers in 2015 Elon Musk co-founded open AI in order to go head-to-head with Google's dominance in the AI World basically Walter Isaacson the guy who wrote The Steve Jobs book is also now writing a book about Elon Musk and this article breaks down some of the story that Elon has about his relationship with AI and how Elon is feeling this increasing urge to try to make AI as safe as possible while at the same time get humans on Mars in case things go haywired also this weekend article is released on Fast Company about why Yan laon isn't buying the AI Doomer narrative if you're not familiar with Yan laon he is one of the Godfathers one of the early ogs of AI in this article he talks about how releasing these AI models to the public to get their hands on in sort of open- source models and things like that will actually help improve these models faster it was actually Lon who urged meta to start open sourcing a lot of their AI models yon laon Compares AI to the invention of the car you can have a car that rides 3 m an hour and crashes often which is what we currently have describing the latest generation of large language models or you can have a car that goes faster so it's scarier but it's got brakes and seat belts and airbags and emergency braking systems that detects obstacles so in many ways it's safer so basically he believes it's completely overblown large language models are prone to hallucinations and have no concept of how the world Works no capacity to plan and no ability to complete basic tasks that a 10-year-old could learn in a matter of minutes they have come nowhere close to achieving human or even animal intelligence he argues and there's little evidence at this point that they will and an even another hot take that came out well at the end of last week Mustafa sulliman the co-founder of inflection Ai and one of the original founders of Deep Mind had a lot

AI updates in terms of service for X Corp: X Corp updated their terms of service to include the ability to train any data on AI.



X Corp, formerly known as Twitter, has updated their terms of service to include the ability to train any data on AI. This means that they can use the information they collect, as well as publicly available information, to train their machine learning or artificial intelligence models. This update has led to speculation that X Corp may merge with xai Corp and use the data trained from Twitter on their upcoming xai platform. This development highlights the growing importance of AI in various industries and the potential for companies to leverage user data for training their AI models.

and is generating a unique script based on what it learned all right now we got a script hey there Tech enthusiasts welcome back to another exciting video on my channel in today's episode we're diving deep into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence why am I reading this myself Let's Have Sam read it instead hey there Tech enthusiasts welcome back to another exciting video on my channel in today's episode we're diving deep into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence not bad not only do I have a script for a YouTube video I could generate audio with all of this text turn it into an audio podcast and I can copy all of this text and turn it into a blog post look at this it even gave me example shots that I can add throughout this so shot of visualization of scientists at the dmth workshop let's go ahead and copy that prompt there do a little control slash and generate an AI image and let's go ahead and generate a visualization of scientists at the dart myth Workshop obviously this is a suggestion for a YouTube video but why not use the same suggestion for the blog post portion as well and there we go now I'd probably take this image and crop out the funky text but that kind of reminds me of one of those like sketches that they show in courtrooms kind of cool so that's cohesive a platform that'll do research for you write content for you generate images for you do the voiceover work for you and even give you ideas for titles for the content when you're done with it once again you can check it out over at cohesive doso and thanks again to cohesive for sponsoring this video you guys rock now on the vein of using AI for audio remember that song that heart on my sleeve song that was like a fake Drake song that went sort of viral by this guy named Ghost Rider well that guy or girl or whoever it was is back at it again with a brand new song song and this time they actually want to try to win a Grammy with it now on September 6th when I actually came across this article they actually had the song playable right here on the website but now it's saying video currently unavailable so apparently it was already taken down I probably wouldn't have played it on this channel anyway cuz I don't want to get my videos taken down this time the song was trying to mimic Travis Scott and 21 Savage in a song called Whiplash and at the very end of the Tik Tok video some text flashed on the screen that said that if Travis Scott and 21 Savage wanted to get in contact he would divert all royalties made from this song over to them and wanted to figure out how to collaborate with musicians on actually moving into whatever the next wave of music is going to be now I personally haven't heard yet whether Travis Scott or 21 Savage actually reached out or if anything's ever going to come of this cuz it looks like Tik tok's already taken it down but I'm sure a quick Google search will help you find it if you really wanted to hear the song now speaking of AI music in a recent video I showed off sunno which makes a tool called chirp and this chirp tool was that tool where you can give it an idea for a song it would generate the song for you with background music and everything and I showed off a version that wasn't quite released yet where you can actually pick the genre of the song and it would make it in that genre sunno just announced this week that chir version one is now available in Discord which is the version that I showed off in that last video a couple weeks ago whenever I posted it so if I jump into Discord real quick if I go into the sunno Discord channel here and I go into one of these chirp beta rooms type slash to get this little pop-up box and then select slash chirp hit enter and it should give me a little dialogue it gives me the option to describe the style of music enter My Own lyrics or have chat GPT make lyrics about so let's do BLU grass and then have chat GPT write me a song about why Future tools is the best place to find

Zoom AI companion: Zoom rebranded Zoom IQ to The Zoom AI companion, which allows users to ask questions and reference past conversations to answer queries.



Zoom recently rebranded their Zoom IQ to The Zoom AI companion. This new feature allows users to ask questions and reference past conversations to get answers. It can pull information from transcribed meetings, chats, emails, and even third-party apps. Users can ask questions during a meeting to catch up on key points, create support tickets, and draft responses. The AI companion can also summarize meetings, identify action items, and surface next steps. This feature is similar to what Google and Microsoft are offering, but it remains to be seen if Zoom can differentiate itself.

there's been a handful of exciting things that have happened in the AI world this week so let's go ahead and break them down starting with the fact that X formerly known as Twitter updated their terms of service to include the ability to train any of your data on AI so they actually updated their terms of service under 2.1 operate improve and personalize our services to say we may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purpose outlined in this policy this article here on stack diary is making the prediction that it's some point Elon is planning on merging X Corp with xai Corp and using all of the data that it trained from Twitter in its new upcoming xai platform also this week Zoom rebranded what it was calling Zoom IQ they're now calling it The Zoom AI companion one of the most interesting things about this Zoom companion is that you'll be able to ask questions of it just like you do with chat GPT and it will reference all the conversations you've had in past Zoom conversations to answer your query in this chat says here users will be able to query the AI companion for the status of projects pulling on transcribed meetings chats whiteboards emails documents and even thirdparty apps they'll be able to ask the AI companion questions during a meeting to catch up on key points create and file support tickets and draft responses to inquiries as well as features that it was already able to do like have the AI companion summarized meetings automatically identifying action items and surfacing next steps Zoom even put out this video showing somebody asking question what has been discussed so far and the AI companion catches the person up as they join the zoom meeting so even if someone's late to the meeting they can still get caught up to date on everything that's been talked about that's something that we also recently saw Google talk about at their Cloud next event when they showed off that they were rolling out similar features with Google duet the video also showed off a handy chapters feature you can see down here at the bottom where you can jump to specific parts of the meeting a lot of these new Zoom features look pretty cool but as we've been seeing a lot of these other platforms like Google and Microsoft are also rolling out pretty much the exact same features inside of their competing products so it'll be interesting to see if Zoom can actually differentiate themselves and do something at least a little bit different from what we're starting to see Google and Microsoft roll out now probably the biggest news in the AI world this week was that the open- source Falcon 180b was launched making it the largest publicly available open-source large language model to date completely eclipsing LL 2's 70 billion parameters the capabilities of Falcon 180b sits somewhere between GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 so you're probably going to get better results and better output then you will with like the free version of chat GPT but not quite as good of results as what you'd see with something like GPT 4 inside of chat GPT it kind of Falls in between and across the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot

close you can do a vary region select the whole thing and just generate another image with the exact same prompt and might actually come out better than what the original image came out as they claim they've got an early version of version 6 ready but they still plan on taking a while to release it they also claim it should be able to generate text but still no estimated release time they plan on releasing the website in two parts the new website that they're launching won't have image generation turned on at first so it's probably just going to be a redesigned mid-journey homepage kind of thing with better search and downloading features supposedly that part two that's coming out whenever they decide decide to release it will have the ability to actually generate images inside of the mid Journey web app and finally get us out of Discord they're also working on a native mobile app it sounds like there's going to be upgrades to the nii model and it sounds like eventually we're going to have video and 3D and they'll probably be coming out about the same time so pretty cool and once again thanks to Ali jws for making these updates on Mid Journey for those of us that don't have several hours to spend in the mid Journey office hours calls speaking of AI art news this week a bunch of artists signed an open letters saying that generative AI is good actually there's been a lot of news and letters and things going around where people are trying to sue companies and shut down in Ai and say AI bad but now it looks like a group of artists are stepping up saying we actually like AI let AI keep doing its thing it's actually making art easier and cooler and giving us new things to play with in the AI World in this snippet it says just like previous Innovations these tools lower barriers in creating art a career that has been traditionally limited to those with considerable fin financial means abled bodies and the right social connections unfortunately the diverse pioneering work of individual human artists is being misrepresented some say it is about merely typing in prompts or regurgitating existing Works others deride our methods and our art as based on stealing and data theft many individual artists are afraid of backlash if they so much as touch these important new tools so it's cool to see that some artists are actually taking a stand going yeah there are some vocal artists over here saying we hate ai ai bad get rid of it AI should go away but that's misrepresentation of the overall art community a big chunk of the art community actually wants to see AI art succeed and get better and do cooler things and in other kind of sort of AI art news Microsoft is actually testing background removal in Microsoft Paint so you can see a demonstration here of a little flappy dude with feathers where Microsoft Paint was just blat out able to remove the background that'll be a pretty handy feature right now I use canva or the Adobe image background remover tool but to have it straight inside of a desktop app and Microsoft Paint I mean could save me a few seconds in having to remove backgrounds a lot of the AI world has actually talked about how Apple seems to be kind of lagging behind in the AI world everything seems to be all about Microsoft and Google and open Ai and Elon Musk and all of that kind of stuff but according to reports apple is actually spending millions of dollars a day on training AI Apple actually believes that Ajax its most advanced language model is more powerful than chat GPT right now Apple's AI team has around 16 members including several former Google Engineers this all comes from an article from the information and they claim that a visual intelligence unit is developing an image generation model and another group is researching multimodal AI which can recognize and produce images or video as well as text now these are all just reports this isn't anything specifically announced by Apple but we definitely shouldn't count Apple

the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot specifically I want to try to rapidly get the news for example let's enter the prompt one of the most exciting scientific discoveries of the 2020s and click submit and you can see it quickly starts generating a response here I do not have personal opinions but I could provide information about some of the most exciting scientific discoveries that have been reported so far in the 2020s here are some examples the development of mRNA vaccines gravitational waves from neutron star mergers crisper detection of water on the moon and then it cut off on number five probably because I have this token limit way down let's see what happens if I bring this token limit way up and try again and you can see by cranking the token limit up I got a much longer output where it gave me a full 10 scientific advances of the 2020s speaking of large language models the not open source anthropic Claud just released a Pro Plan and it seems very similar to what chat GPT did with their Pro Plan if we take a peak here it costs 20 bucks a month to use it and what you get for it is five times more usage than the free tier provides which is interesting because I've actually never gotten to my limit on the free tier I've I mean I use clad quite a bit but I've never pushed that limit to where it says I can't use it anymore so I'm not actually sure where the free tier limit is yet you get Priority Access to Cloud AI during high traffic periods very similar to what chat GPT did and of course you get early access to new features that help you get the most out of CLA now personally I use clad more than chat GPT these days I use it for summarizing articles when I write my Friday newsletters I actually have it double check a lot of the grammar and spelling for me on those newsletters it's been been a pretty valuable resource to me but again I actually haven't hit my limits yet of what the free plan is capable of this week open AI introduced a canva plugin for chat GPT plus subscribers to enhance content creation taking a peak here if I come over to my chat GPT account click on the gp4 up here click on plugins click where it says no plugins enabled and then click on the plugin store let's do a quick search for canva install the canva plugin and now that we have the canva plugin selected let's test this quick here recommended by Paul CU I'm launching my new air related app create a real Instagram template related to Ai and new technologies let's see what happens if we use that exact same prompt here over on chat GPT paste that in there and it actually gave us a bunch of templates here dark blue futuristic AI the future Instagram post I click on check it out it opens up my canva and this post is right here inside of canva what it did was it found an existing template for me and it just opened that template for me in canva it was an exist exting one here's one called abstract artificial intelligence technologyfree logo not a bad looking logo but I have a feeling it's not unique and right there you can see it's already a pre-made template so this plugin is not actually building anything for us it's just essentially searching canva for existing templates based on what we asked for still

Google duet: Google rolled out similar features to Zoom AI companion with Google duet.



Google has introduced similar features to Zoom's AI companion with their own product called Google duet. This means that users will be able to ask questions and get information during meetings, just like with Zoom's AI companion. Additionally, Google duet will have a chapters feature, allowing users to jump to specific parts of the meeting. It's worth noting that other platforms like Microsoft are also rolling out similar features, so it will be interesting to see how Zoom can differentiate themselves.

Canva plugin for chat GPT: OpenAI introduced a Canva plugin for chat GPT plus subscribers to enhance content creation.



OpenAI has introduced a Canva plugin for chat GPT plus subscribers. This plugin allows users to enhance their content creation by searching for existing templates in Canva based on their prompts. It saves time by finding relevant templates and opening them directly in Canva. While the plugin does not build anything new, it simplifies the process of finding the right template for users. This feature is beneficial for those who want to create visually appealing content without the hassle of searching through Canva's templates manually.

close you can do a vary region select the whole thing and just generate another image with the exact same prompt and might actually come out better than what the original image came out as they claim they've got an early version of version 6 ready but they still plan on taking a while to release it they also claim it should be able to generate text but still no estimated release time they plan on releasing the website in two parts the new website that they're launching won't have image generation turned on at first so it's probably just going to be a redesigned mid-journey homepage kind of thing with better search and downloading features supposedly that part two that's coming out whenever they decide decide to release it will have the ability to actually generate images inside of the mid Journey web app and finally get us out of Discord they're also working on a native mobile app it sounds like there's going to be upgrades to the nii model and it sounds like eventually we're going to have video and 3D and they'll probably be coming out about the same time so pretty cool and once again thanks to Ali jws for making these updates on Mid Journey for those of us that don't have several hours to spend in the mid Journey office hours calls speaking of AI art news this week a bunch of artists signed an open letters saying that generative AI is good actually there's been a lot of news and letters and things going around where people are trying to sue companies and shut down in Ai and say AI bad but now it looks like a group of artists are stepping up saying we actually like AI let AI keep doing its thing it's actually making art easier and cooler and giving us new things to play with in the AI World in this snippet it says just like previous Innovations these tools lower barriers in creating art a career that has been traditionally limited to those with considerable fin financial means abled bodies and the right social connections unfortunately the diverse pioneering work of individual human artists is being misrepresented some say it is about merely typing in prompts or regurgitating existing Works others deride our methods and our art as based on stealing and data theft many individual artists are afraid of backlash if they so much as touch these important new tools so it's cool to see that some artists are actually taking a stand going yeah there are some vocal artists over here saying we hate ai ai bad get rid of it AI should go away but that's misrepresentation of the overall art community a big chunk of the art community actually wants to see AI art succeed and get better and do cooler things and in other kind of sort of AI art news Microsoft is actually testing background removal in Microsoft Paint so you can see a demonstration here of a little flappy dude with feathers where Microsoft Paint was just blat out able to remove the background that'll be a pretty handy feature right now I use canva or the Adobe image background remover tool but to have it straight inside of a desktop app and Microsoft Paint I mean could save me a few seconds in having to remove backgrounds a lot of the AI world has actually talked about how Apple seems to be kind of lagging behind in the AI world everything seems to be all about Microsoft and Google and open Ai and Elon Musk and all of that kind of stuff but according to reports apple is actually spending millions of dollars a day on training AI Apple actually believes that Ajax its most advanced language model is more powerful than chat GPT right now Apple's AI team has around 16 members including several former Google Engineers this all comes from an article from the information and they claim that a visual intelligence unit is developing an image generation model and another group is researching multimodal AI which can recognize and produce images or video as well as text now these are all just reports this isn't anything specifically announced by Apple but we definitely shouldn't count Apple

related to Ai and new technologies let's see what happens if we use that exact same prompt here over on chat GPT paste that in there and it actually gave us a bunch of templates here dark blue futuristic AI the future Instagram post I click on check it out it opens up my canva and this post is right here inside of canva what it did was it found an existing template for me and it just opened that template for me in canva it was an exist exting one here's one called abstract artificial intelligence technologyfree logo not a bad looking logo but I have a feeling it's not unique and right there you can see it's already a pre-made template so this plugin is not actually building anything for us it's just essentially searching canva for existing templates based on what we asked for still pretty handy because sometimes searching through canva for the exact right template could be tedious so chat GPT just bringing the five most relevant to our attention actually kind of useful and speaking of AI they'll be hosting their first ever developer conference on November 6th if we take a peek here at the official announcement the developer conference will be in San Francisco and it'll bring hundreds of developers from around the world together with the team at openai to preview new tools and exchange ideas so that'll be really interesting cuz there could be some new announcements and new functionality of chat GPT that gets revealed during this event in this quick post on the open AI site Sam Alman said we're looking forward to showing our latest work to enable developers to to build new things now I'm not clear if Sam Elman or Greg Brockman or Ilia suser or any of the you know Big Wigs over at open AI are actually going to be in attendance but that would be pretty cool if they are if I wasn't going to be on a family vacation during that exact week I'd probably make the trip up next I want to tell you about the sponsor of today's video cohesive doso cohesive is an all-in-one text generation platform image generation platform and it even does text to speech with realistic voices and to make it even simpler than that they have tons and tons and tons of templates that you can use so you're not starting from scratch you don't need to be some crazy prompt engineer just pick a template like a transactional email or a legal memo generator or maybe you want to create a romance audio book they got it in here it took me forever to scroll to the bottom but when I finally got here some of the stuff that's hidden way down here menu prompt calls appointment reminder calls a subpoena generator but let's go ahead and use the one that I'm probably most likely to use myself here a script for a YouTube video it already already starts the prompt off for me here write a YouTube video script for a 5-minute history of artificial intelligence target audience Tech enthusiasts video length 5 minutes sounds about right I'm going to leave the reference links empty let's just see what it generates itself and click go it's doing the research for me it found a few YouTube videos so let's go ahead and click generate all right so now it's actually read the transcripts of those YouTube videos and is generating a unique script based on what it learned all right now we got a script hey there Tech enthusiasts welcome back to another exciting video on my channel in today's episode we're diving deep into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence why am I reading this myself Let's Have Sam read it instead hey there Tech enthusiasts welcome back to another exciting video on my channel in today's episode we're diving deep into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence not bad not only do I have a script for a YouTube video I could generate audio with all of this text turn it into an audio podcast and I can copy all of this text and turn it into a blog post look at this it even gave me example shots that I can add throughout this so shot of visualization of scientists at

of lagging behind in the AI world everything seems to be all about Microsoft and Google and open Ai and Elon Musk and all of that kind of stuff but according to reports apple is actually spending millions of dollars a day on training AI Apple actually believes that Ajax its most advanced language model is more powerful than chat GPT right now Apple's AI team has around 16 members including several former Google Engineers this all comes from an article from the information and they claim that a visual intelligence unit is developing an image generation model and another group is researching multimodal AI which can recognize and produce images or video as well as text now these are all just reports this isn't anything specifically announced by Apple but we definitely shouldn't count Apple out of the AI race they are definitely doing a ton of crazy AI stuff behind the scenes so this is pretty interesting it's actually called Amazon one and it's a tool where you it actually scans your hand and it can use it for payments and loyalty cards and entry access and various ways to identify you by your palm and they actually use generative AI to train this in fact they created a whole bunch of synthetic hands using Ai and trained it on these synthetic hands to help better recognize real hands and supposedly it's more accurate than scanning your retinas the idea being that in the future if you want to pay with credit cards you need to show identification you want to access entry to a concert or something like that you no longer need to scan your phone or a ticket you just wave your palm over a sensor and it knows that you're you and you're supposed to be there this week an article came out in Time Magazine all about Elon musk's struggle for the future of AI now it's quite a hefty read but basically it sort of breaks down elon's history with AI it talks about how he's been deeply concerned about about the risks of uncontrolled Ai and how he actually had arguments with Larry pagee who called him a species for wanting to Value lives of humans over potential consciousness of computers in 2015 Elon Musk co-founded open AI in order to go head-to-head with Google's dominance in the AI World basically Walter Isaacson the guy who wrote The Steve Jobs book is also now writing a book about Elon Musk and this article breaks down some of the story that Elon has about his relationship with AI and how Elon is feeling this increasing urge to try to make AI as safe as possible while at the same time get humans on Mars in case things go haywired also this weekend article is released on Fast Company about why Yan laon isn't buying the AI Doomer narrative if you're not familiar with Yan laon he is one of the Godfathers one of the early ogs of AI in this article he talks about how releasing these AI models to the public to get their hands on in sort of open- source models and things like that will actually help improve these models faster it was actually Lon who urged meta to start open sourcing a lot of their AI models yon laon Compares AI to the invention of the car you can have a car that rides 3 m an hour and crashes often which is what we currently have describing the latest generation of large language models or you can have a car that goes faster so it's scarier but it's got brakes and seat belts and airbags and emergency braking systems that detects obstacles so in many ways it's safer so basically he believes it's completely overblown large language models are prone to hallucinations and have no concept of how the world Works no capacity to plan and no ability to complete basic tasks that a 10-year-old could learn in a matter of minutes they have come nowhere close to achieving human or even animal intelligence he argues and there's little evidence at this point that they will and an even another hot take that came out well at the end of last week Mustafa sulliman the co-founder of inflection Ai and one of the original founders of Deep Mind had a lot

and everything and I showed off a version that wasn't quite released yet where you can actually pick the genre of the song and it would make it in that genre sunno just announced this week that chir version one is now available in Discord which is the version that I showed off in that last video a couple weeks ago whenever I posted it so if I jump into Discord real quick if I go into the sunno Discord channel here and I go into one of these chirp beta rooms type slash to get this little pop-up box and then select slash chirp hit enter and it should give me a little dialogue it gives me the option to describe the style of music enter My Own lyrics or have chat GPT make lyrics about so let's do BLU grass and then have chat GPT write me a song about why Future tools is the best place to find out about new AI tools it already generated the lyrics here for me and after 69.6 2 seconds I've got two versions back I was searching for and wide for tools that would guide to Future tools I came where opportunities reside with their expertise and insight my worries were set aside the best place to find new AI tools I cannot hide Future tools all Future tools and knowledge they in part the Pioneers leing the way in the say off I was really digging that song here's the other version it did I wasar and wide guide Future tools I came where opportunities die with her expertise and insight my worries were set aside the best place to find new where I tools I cannot hide Future tools oh Future tools the knowledge they impart they're the Pioneers leading the way in this AI covering Innovations right from the very start they're actually really good I wish there was a way to extend them but this is now available for anybody to play with and as of right now it's actually free to use but if we take a peek over at their announcement they do have a free and a Pro Plan all users are automatically subscribed to the free plan upon joining Sun's Discord the free plan includes 250 credits or 25 chirps per month and free subscribers will still be able to work Solo in their DMS the Pro Plan on the other hand is 10 bucks a month and it gives subscribers a th000 credits or 100 chirps per month the ability to buy additional Generations priority in the queue and more features that will come soon but at the very least go check it out generate a couple songs on the free tier and see what it can do cuz it's kind of a blast now let's talk about the world of AI art for a second not a ton of huge Revelations this week in AI art however my good friend Ali jwes did hang out on the mid Journey office hours and as always reported back to x with what they talked about it sounds like sometime in September version 5. 3 is going to be released with new Aesthetics they also admitted on the call that when you are using the inpaint feature it actually generates better images when you inpaint with the full canvas so for example if I take an image like this click on vary region and then literally select the whole image like that and then generate again it actually uses a slightly newer model of mid Journey which often gets you better results so if you generate an image that you like and it's fairly close you can do a vary region select the whole thing and just generate another image with the exact same prompt and might actually come out better than what the original image came out as they claim they've got an early version of version 6 ready but they still plan on taking a while to release it they also claim it should be able to generate text but still no estimated release time they plan on releasing the website in two parts the new website that they're launching won't have image generation turned on at first so it's probably just going to be a redesigned mid-journey homepage kind of thing with better search and downloading features supposedly that part two that's coming out whenever they decide decide to release it will have the ability to actually generate images inside of the mid

the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot specifically I want to try to rapidly get the news for example let's enter the prompt one of the most exciting scientific discoveries of the 2020s and click submit and you can see it quickly starts generating a response here I do not have personal opinions but I could provide information about some of the most exciting scientific discoveries that have been reported so far in the 2020s here are some examples the development of mRNA vaccines gravitational waves from neutron star mergers crisper detection of water on the moon and then it cut off on number five probably because I have this token limit way down let's see what happens if I bring this token limit way up and try again and you can see by cranking the token limit up I got a much longer output where it gave me a full 10 scientific advances of the 2020s speaking of large language models the not open source anthropic Claud just released a Pro Plan and it seems very similar to what chat GPT did with their Pro Plan if we take a peak here it costs 20 bucks a month to use it and what you get for it is five times more usage than the free tier provides which is interesting because I've actually never gotten to my limit on the free tier I've I mean I use clad quite a bit but I've never pushed that limit to where it says I can't use it anymore so I'm not actually sure where the free tier limit is yet you get Priority Access to Cloud AI during high traffic periods very similar to what chat GPT did and of course you get early access to new features that help you get the most out of CLA now personally I use clad more than chat GPT these days I use it for summarizing articles when I write my Friday newsletters I actually have it double check a lot of the grammar and spelling for me on those newsletters it's been been a pretty valuable resource to me but again I actually haven't hit my limits yet of what the free plan is capable of this week open AI introduced a canva plugin for chat GPT plus subscribers to enhance content creation taking a peak here if I come over to my chat GPT account click on the gp4 up here click on plugins click where it says no plugins enabled and then click on the plugin store let's do a quick search for canva install the canva plugin and now that we have the canva plugin selected let's test this quick here recommended by Paul CU I'm launching my new air related app create a real Instagram template related to Ai and new technologies let's see what happens if we use that exact same prompt here over on chat GPT paste that in there and it actually gave us a bunch of templates here dark blue futuristic AI the future Instagram post I click on check it out it opens up my canva and this post is right here inside of canva what it did was it found an existing template for me and it just opened that template for me in canva it was an exist exting one here's one called abstract artificial intelligence technologyfree logo not a bad looking logo but I have a feeling it's not unique and right there you can see it's already a pre-made template so this plugin is not actually building anything for us it's just essentially searching canva for existing templates based on what we asked for still

Inpaint feature: Generating better images by inpainting with the full canvas.



According to the updates from Mid Journey, it has been revealed that when using the inpaint feature, generating better images is possible by inpainting with the full canvas. This means that if you select the entire image as the region for inpainting, the results are likely to be improved. This information was shared during the Mid Journey office hours call, and it is a useful tip for users looking to enhance their image generation experience.

and everything and I showed off a version that wasn't quite released yet where you can actually pick the genre of the song and it would make it in that genre sunno just announced this week that chir version one is now available in Discord which is the version that I showed off in that last video a couple weeks ago whenever I posted it so if I jump into Discord real quick if I go into the sunno Discord channel here and I go into one of these chirp beta rooms type slash to get this little pop-up box and then select slash chirp hit enter and it should give me a little dialogue it gives me the option to describe the style of music enter My Own lyrics or have chat GPT make lyrics about so let's do BLU grass and then have chat GPT write me a song about why Future tools is the best place to find out about new AI tools it already generated the lyrics here for me and after 69.6 2 seconds I've got two versions back I was searching for and wide for tools that would guide to Future tools I came where opportunities reside with their expertise and insight my worries were set aside the best place to find new AI tools I cannot hide Future tools all Future tools and knowledge they in part the Pioneers leing the way in the say off I was really digging that song here's the other version it did I wasar and wide guide Future tools I came where opportunities die with her expertise and insight my worries were set aside the best place to find new where I tools I cannot hide Future tools oh Future tools the knowledge they impart they're the Pioneers leading the way in this AI covering Innovations right from the very start they're actually really good I wish there was a way to extend them but this is now available for anybody to play with and as of right now it's actually free to use but if we take a peek over at their announcement they do have a free and a Pro Plan all users are automatically subscribed to the free plan upon joining Sun's Discord the free plan includes 250 credits or 25 chirps per month and free subscribers will still be able to work Solo in their DMS the Pro Plan on the other hand is 10 bucks a month and it gives subscribers a th000 credits or 100 chirps per month the ability to buy additional Generations priority in the queue and more features that will come soon but at the very least go check it out generate a couple songs on the free tier and see what it can do cuz it's kind of a blast now let's talk about the world of AI art for a second not a ton of huge Revelations this week in AI art however my good friend Ali jwes did hang out on the mid Journey office hours and as always reported back to x with what they talked about it sounds like sometime in September version 5. 3 is going to be released with new Aesthetics they also admitted on the call that when you are using the inpaint feature it actually generates better images when you inpaint with the full canvas so for example if I take an image like this click on vary region and then literally select the whole image like that and then generate again it actually uses a slightly newer model of mid Journey which often gets you better results so if you generate an image that you like and it's fairly close you can do a vary region select the whole thing and just generate another image with the exact same prompt and might actually come out better than what the original image came out as they claim they've got an early version of version 6 ready but they still plan on taking a while to release it they also claim it should be able to generate text but still no estimated release time they plan on releasing the website in two parts the new website that they're launching won't have image generation turned on at first so it's probably just going to be a redesigned mid-journey homepage kind of thing with better search and downloading features supposedly that part two that's coming out whenever they decide decide to release it will have the ability to actually generate images inside of the mid

there's been a handful of exciting things that have happened in the AI world this week so let's go ahead and break them down starting with the fact that X formerly known as Twitter updated their terms of service to include the ability to train any of your data on AI so they actually updated their terms of service under 2.1 operate improve and personalize our services to say we may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purpose outlined in this policy this article here on stack diary is making the prediction that it's some point Elon is planning on merging X Corp with xai Corp and using all of the data that it trained from Twitter in its new upcoming xai platform also this week Zoom rebranded what it was calling Zoom IQ they're now calling it The Zoom AI companion one of the most interesting things about this Zoom companion is that you'll be able to ask questions of it just like you do with chat GPT and it will reference all the conversations you've had in past Zoom conversations to answer your query in this chat says here users will be able to query the AI companion for the status of projects pulling on transcribed meetings chats whiteboards emails documents and even thirdparty apps they'll be able to ask the AI companion questions during a meeting to catch up on key points create and file support tickets and draft responses to inquiries as well as features that it was already able to do like have the AI companion summarized meetings automatically identifying action items and surfacing next steps Zoom even put out this video showing somebody asking question what has been discussed so far and the AI companion catches the person up as they join the zoom meeting so even if someone's late to the meeting they can still get caught up to date on everything that's been talked about that's something that we also recently saw Google talk about at their Cloud next event when they showed off that they were rolling out similar features with Google duet the video also showed off a handy chapters feature you can see down here at the bottom where you can jump to specific parts of the meeting a lot of these new Zoom features look pretty cool but as we've been seeing a lot of these other platforms like Google and Microsoft are also rolling out pretty much the exact same features inside of their competing products so it'll be interesting to see if Zoom can actually differentiate themselves and do something at least a little bit different from what we're starting to see Google and Microsoft roll out now probably the biggest news in the AI world this week was that the open- source Falcon 180b was launched making it the largest publicly available open-source large language model to date completely eclipsing LL 2's 70 billion parameters the capabilities of Falcon 180b sits somewhere between GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 so you're probably going to get better results and better output then you will with like the free version of chat GPT but not quite as good of results as what you'd see with something like GPT 4 inside of chat GPT it kind of Falls in between and across the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot

the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot specifically I want to try to rapidly get the news for example let's enter the prompt one of the most exciting scientific discoveries of the 2020s and click submit and you can see it quickly starts generating a response here I do not have personal opinions but I could provide information about some of the most exciting scientific discoveries that have been reported so far in the 2020s here are some examples the development of mRNA vaccines gravitational waves from neutron star mergers crisper detection of water on the moon and then it cut off on number five probably because I have this token limit way down let's see what happens if I bring this token limit way up and try again and you can see by cranking the token limit up I got a much longer output where it gave me a full 10 scientific advances of the 2020s speaking of large language models the not open source anthropic Claud just released a Pro Plan and it seems very similar to what chat GPT did with their Pro Plan if we take a peak here it costs 20 bucks a month to use it and what you get for it is five times more usage than the free tier provides which is interesting because I've actually never gotten to my limit on the free tier I've I mean I use clad quite a bit but I've never pushed that limit to where it says I can't use it anymore so I'm not actually sure where the free tier limit is yet you get Priority Access to Cloud AI during high traffic periods very similar to what chat GPT did and of course you get early access to new features that help you get the most out of CLA now personally I use clad more than chat GPT these days I use it for summarizing articles when I write my Friday newsletters I actually have it double check a lot of the grammar and spelling for me on those newsletters it's been been a pretty valuable resource to me but again I actually haven't hit my limits yet of what the free plan is capable of this week open AI introduced a canva plugin for chat GPT plus subscribers to enhance content creation taking a peak here if I come over to my chat GPT account click on the gp4 up here click on plugins click where it says no plugins enabled and then click on the plugin store let's do a quick search for canva install the canva plugin and now that we have the canva plugin selected let's test this quick here recommended by Paul CU I'm launching my new air related app create a real Instagram template related to Ai and new technologies let's see what happens if we use that exact same prompt here over on chat GPT paste that in there and it actually gave us a bunch of templates here dark blue futuristic AI the future Instagram post I click on check it out it opens up my canva and this post is right here inside of canva what it did was it found an existing template for me and it just opened that template for me in canva it was an exist exting one here's one called abstract artificial intelligence technologyfree logo not a bad looking logo but I have a feeling it's not unique and right there you can see it's already a pre-made template so this plugin is not actually building anything for us it's just essentially searching canva for existing templates based on what we asked for still

Mid Journey: Updates on Mid Journey, including a newer model and plans for text generation.



Mid Journey is planning to release version 6 of their website, which will include image generation and text generation capabilities. They have an early version of version 6 ready, but the release date is still unknown. The new website will be launched in two parts, with the first part focusing on a redesigned homepage and improved search and downloading features. The second part, which will be released later, will include the ability to generate images and text within the Mid Journey web app. Additionally, Mid Journey is working on a native mobile app and exploring upgrades to the Nii model, as well as the possibility of video and 3D capabilities.

about to dramatically change the world not necessarily in the negative positive sense in the sense that we just need to rethink everything we need to rethink how we see labor and work and what the humans roles on the Planet are so three completely different thought processes around Ai and hard to say which one I sort of lead to I definitely think there's probably bits and pieces of all three of them that I could relate to so I just love going down these rabbit holes and hearing what others think about it and getting my own thought spinning on where this is all headed in my mind it's just fascinating the smartest people that are out there actually building this stuff the Elon Musk the Yan lacons the Mustafa Sans these people are all on the inside they're seeing this stuff being built they know better than anybody else where this is heading and so to get three articles within one week of all of their thought processes of where this is right now it's just fascinating to me to sort of put them all together and have that sort of holistic view of where AI could potentially be heading and finally to wrap this video up Time released their top 100 most influential people in AI this week they broke it down into four categories they also picked tops of each category such as Dario and danello am modai I'm not sure if I pronounced that or not but they're the presidents of anthropic who we talked about earlier in this video of course Sam Alman deiss hassabis Elon Musk Jensen hang and Mustafa sulliman who we also just mentioned there's the innovators led by Ted Chang Shapers led by Alandra Nelson but also including Eric Schmidt from Google elaser yatkowski someone who literally believes that at the pace AI is going we have about a year left on this planet and finally the thinkers led by Jeffrey H Hinton The Godfather of AI also including Yan laon who we talked about earlier in this video Ilia suser the co-founder of open Ai and many others there are some omissions to this list that I found interesting it's interesting to me that Ahmad mustak from stability AI didn't make the list I also kind of find it a bummer that creators who are also sort of pointing people in the direction of a lot of the Innovations didn't make the list either but I can't complain about that too much but there definitely are people out there that are really helping push the AI narrative forward people like Robert scobble and Rowan Chung and Ben tossel and maybe I tossed myself in there as well we're trying to do our best to keep the public informed about where AI is going but again this is just the top 100 maybe we'd fall into the top 200 who knows anyway that's all I got for you today I really appreciate you if you haven't already check out futur tools. where I curate all the coolest AI tools that I come across I keep the AI news up to date on a daily basis I'm adding new tools every single day added 12 tools in the last 24 hours that's a little too much for you make sure you join the free newsletter and once or twice a week I'll send you an update with all the latest news that you need to know just the coolest tools I've come across and a few YouTube videos to make sure you keep coming back and watching more and once again thank you so much to cohesive for sponsoring this video I really appreciate it you make it possible for me to keep on making videos like this for a living so I really really appreciate you and thank you so much for watching if you like this kind of video maybe give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel I'd really appreciate it all right thanks again see you in the next one bye-bye [Music] I

AI art: Artists signing an open letter in support of generative AI and its impact on the art community.



A group of artists have signed an open letter expressing their support for generative AI in the art community. They argue that AI tools have lowered barriers in creating art, making it more accessible to a wider range of artists. They also address the misconception that AI art is simply regurgitating existing works or based on stealing and data theft. The letter highlights the positive impact of AI in making art easier and more innovative. This shows that there is a significant portion of the art community that wants to see AI art succeed and continue to push boundaries.

there's been a handful of exciting things that have happened in the AI world this week so let's go ahead and break them down starting with the fact that X formerly known as Twitter updated their terms of service to include the ability to train any of your data on AI so they actually updated their terms of service under 2.1 operate improve and personalize our services to say we may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purpose outlined in this policy this article here on stack diary is making the prediction that it's some point Elon is planning on merging X Corp with xai Corp and using all of the data that it trained from Twitter in its new upcoming xai platform also this week Zoom rebranded what it was calling Zoom IQ they're now calling it The Zoom AI companion one of the most interesting things about this Zoom companion is that you'll be able to ask questions of it just like you do with chat GPT and it will reference all the conversations you've had in past Zoom conversations to answer your query in this chat says here users will be able to query the AI companion for the status of projects pulling on transcribed meetings chats whiteboards emails documents and even thirdparty apps they'll be able to ask the AI companion questions during a meeting to catch up on key points create and file support tickets and draft responses to inquiries as well as features that it was already able to do like have the AI companion summarized meetings automatically identifying action items and surfacing next steps Zoom even put out this video showing somebody asking question what has been discussed so far and the AI companion catches the person up as they join the zoom meeting so even if someone's late to the meeting they can still get caught up to date on everything that's been talked about that's something that we also recently saw Google talk about at their Cloud next event when they showed off that they were rolling out similar features with Google duet the video also showed off a handy chapters feature you can see down here at the bottom where you can jump to specific parts of the meeting a lot of these new Zoom features look pretty cool but as we've been seeing a lot of these other platforms like Google and Microsoft are also rolling out pretty much the exact same features inside of their competing products so it'll be interesting to see if Zoom can actually differentiate themselves and do something at least a little bit different from what we're starting to see Google and Microsoft roll out now probably the biggest news in the AI world this week was that the open- source Falcon 180b was launched making it the largest publicly available open-source large language model to date completely eclipsing LL 2's 70 billion parameters the capabilities of Falcon 180b sits somewhere between GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 so you're probably going to get better results and better output then you will with like the free version of chat GPT but not quite as good of results as what you'd see with something like GPT 4 inside of chat GPT it kind of Falls in between and across the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot

the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot specifically I want to try to rapidly get the news for example let's enter the prompt one of the most exciting scientific discoveries of the 2020s and click submit and you can see it quickly starts generating a response here I do not have personal opinions but I could provide information about some of the most exciting scientific discoveries that have been reported so far in the 2020s here are some examples the development of mRNA vaccines gravitational waves from neutron star mergers crisper detection of water on the moon and then it cut off on number five probably because I have this token limit way down let's see what happens if I bring this token limit way up and try again and you can see by cranking the token limit up I got a much longer output where it gave me a full 10 scientific advances of the 2020s speaking of large language models the not open source anthropic Claud just released a Pro Plan and it seems very similar to what chat GPT did with their Pro Plan if we take a peak here it costs 20 bucks a month to use it and what you get for it is five times more usage than the free tier provides which is interesting because I've actually never gotten to my limit on the free tier I've I mean I use clad quite a bit but I've never pushed that limit to where it says I can't use it anymore so I'm not actually sure where the free tier limit is yet you get Priority Access to Cloud AI during high traffic periods very similar to what chat GPT did and of course you get early access to new features that help you get the most out of CLA now personally I use clad more than chat GPT these days I use it for summarizing articles when I write my Friday newsletters I actually have it double check a lot of the grammar and spelling for me on those newsletters it's been been a pretty valuable resource to me but again I actually haven't hit my limits yet of what the free plan is capable of this week open AI introduced a canva plugin for chat GPT plus subscribers to enhance content creation taking a peak here if I come over to my chat GPT account click on the gp4 up here click on plugins click where it says no plugins enabled and then click on the plugin store let's do a quick search for canva install the canva plugin and now that we have the canva plugin selected let's test this quick here recommended by Paul CU I'm launching my new air related app create a real Instagram template related to Ai and new technologies let's see what happens if we use that exact same prompt here over on chat GPT paste that in there and it actually gave us a bunch of templates here dark blue futuristic AI the future Instagram post I click on check it out it opens up my canva and this post is right here inside of canva what it did was it found an existing template for me and it just opened that template for me in canva it was an exist exting one here's one called abstract artificial intelligence technologyfree logo not a bad looking logo but I have a feeling it's not unique and right there you can see it's already a pre-made template so this plugin is not actually building anything for us it's just essentially searching canva for existing templates based on what we asked for still

Microsoft Paint: Testing background removal feature in Microsoft Paint using AI.



Microsoft is testing a background removal feature in Microsoft Paint using AI. This feature allows users to easily remove the background from an image, saving time and effort. While other tools like Canva and Adobe already offer similar features, having it integrated directly into Microsoft Paint could be convenient for users. This update shows that Microsoft is actively working on incorporating AI capabilities into their products, keeping up with other tech giants in the AI space.

Apple's AI efforts: Apple's investment in AI, including language models and visual intelligence.



According to reports, Apple is investing millions of dollars a day in training AI. They believe that their most advanced language model, Ajax, is more powerful than chat GPT. Apple's AI team consists of former Google engineers and is working on developing an image generation model and researching multimodal AI. While these are just reports and not officially announced by Apple, it shows that they are actively involved in the AI race and should not be counted out.

the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot specifically I want to try to rapidly get the news for example let's enter the prompt one of the most exciting scientific discoveries of the 2020s and click submit and you can see it quickly starts generating a response here I do not have personal opinions but I could provide information about some of the most exciting scientific discoveries that have been reported so far in the 2020s here are some examples the development of mRNA vaccines gravitational waves from neutron star mergers crisper detection of water on the moon and then it cut off on number five probably because I have this token limit way down let's see what happens if I bring this token limit way up and try again and you can see by cranking the token limit up I got a much longer output where it gave me a full 10 scientific advances of the 2020s speaking of large language models the not open source anthropic Claud just released a Pro Plan and it seems very similar to what chat GPT did with their Pro Plan if we take a peak here it costs 20 bucks a month to use it and what you get for it is five times more usage than the free tier provides which is interesting because I've actually never gotten to my limit on the free tier I've I mean I use clad quite a bit but I've never pushed that limit to where it says I can't use it anymore so I'm not actually sure where the free tier limit is yet you get Priority Access to Cloud AI during high traffic periods very similar to what chat GPT did and of course you get early access to new features that help you get the most out of CLA now personally I use clad more than chat GPT these days I use it for summarizing articles when I write my Friday newsletters I actually have it double check a lot of the grammar and spelling for me on those newsletters it's been been a pretty valuable resource to me but again I actually haven't hit my limits yet of what the free plan is capable of this week open AI introduced a canva plugin for chat GPT plus subscribers to enhance content creation taking a peak here if I come over to my chat GPT account click on the gp4 up here click on plugins click where it says no plugins enabled and then click on the plugin store let's do a quick search for canva install the canva plugin and now that we have the canva plugin selected let's test this quick here recommended by Paul CU I'm launching my new air related app create a real Instagram template related to Ai and new technologies let's see what happens if we use that exact same prompt here over on chat GPT paste that in there and it actually gave us a bunch of templates here dark blue futuristic AI the future Instagram post I click on check it out it opens up my canva and this post is right here inside of canva what it did was it found an existing template for me and it just opened that template for me in canva it was an exist exting one here's one called abstract artificial intelligence technologyfree logo not a bad looking logo but I have a feeling it's not unique and right there you can see it's already a pre-made template so this plugin is not actually building anything for us it's just essentially searching canva for existing templates based on what we asked for still

there's been a handful of exciting things that have happened in the AI world this week so let's go ahead and break them down starting with the fact that X formerly known as Twitter updated their terms of service to include the ability to train any of your data on AI so they actually updated their terms of service under 2.1 operate improve and personalize our services to say we may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purpose outlined in this policy this article here on stack diary is making the prediction that it's some point Elon is planning on merging X Corp with xai Corp and using all of the data that it trained from Twitter in its new upcoming xai platform also this week Zoom rebranded what it was calling Zoom IQ they're now calling it The Zoom AI companion one of the most interesting things about this Zoom companion is that you'll be able to ask questions of it just like you do with chat GPT and it will reference all the conversations you've had in past Zoom conversations to answer your query in this chat says here users will be able to query the AI companion for the status of projects pulling on transcribed meetings chats whiteboards emails documents and even thirdparty apps they'll be able to ask the AI companion questions during a meeting to catch up on key points create and file support tickets and draft responses to inquiries as well as features that it was already able to do like have the AI companion summarized meetings automatically identifying action items and surfacing next steps Zoom even put out this video showing somebody asking question what has been discussed so far and the AI companion catches the person up as they join the zoom meeting so even if someone's late to the meeting they can still get caught up to date on everything that's been talked about that's something that we also recently saw Google talk about at their Cloud next event when they showed off that they were rolling out similar features with Google duet the video also showed off a handy chapters feature you can see down here at the bottom where you can jump to specific parts of the meeting a lot of these new Zoom features look pretty cool but as we've been seeing a lot of these other platforms like Google and Microsoft are also rolling out pretty much the exact same features inside of their competing products so it'll be interesting to see if Zoom can actually differentiate themselves and do something at least a little bit different from what we're starting to see Google and Microsoft roll out now probably the biggest news in the AI world this week was that the open- source Falcon 180b was launched making it the largest publicly available open-source large language model to date completely eclipsing LL 2's 70 billion parameters the capabilities of Falcon 180b sits somewhere between GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 so you're probably going to get better results and better output then you will with like the free version of chat GPT but not quite as good of results as what you'd see with something like GPT 4 inside of chat GPT it kind of Falls in between and across the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot

Amazon One: A tool that uses generative AI to scan and identify individuals by their palm for various purposes.



Amazon One is a tool developed by Amazon that utilizes generative AI to scan and identify individuals based on their palm. It can be used for purposes such as making payments, accessing loyalty cards, and granting entry access. The tool has been trained using synthetic hands created with AI, making it more accurate than other identification methods like retina scanning. The idea behind Amazon One is to eliminate the need for physical cards or tickets by simply waving your palm over a sensor for verification.

about to dramatically change the world not necessarily in the negative positive sense in the sense that we just need to rethink everything we need to rethink how we see labor and work and what the humans roles on the Planet are so three completely different thought processes around Ai and hard to say which one I sort of lead to I definitely think there's probably bits and pieces of all three of them that I could relate to so I just love going down these rabbit holes and hearing what others think about it and getting my own thought spinning on where this is all headed in my mind it's just fascinating the smartest people that are out there actually building this stuff the Elon Musk the Yan lacons the Mustafa Sans these people are all on the inside they're seeing this stuff being built they know better than anybody else where this is heading and so to get three articles within one week of all of their thought processes of where this is right now it's just fascinating to me to sort of put them all together and have that sort of holistic view of where AI could potentially be heading and finally to wrap this video up Time released their top 100 most influential people in AI this week they broke it down into four categories they also picked tops of each category such as Dario and danello am modai I'm not sure if I pronounced that or not but they're the presidents of anthropic who we talked about earlier in this video of course Sam Alman deiss hassabis Elon Musk Jensen hang and Mustafa sulliman who we also just mentioned there's the innovators led by Ted Chang Shapers led by Alandra Nelson but also including Eric Schmidt from Google elaser yatkowski someone who literally believes that at the pace AI is going we have about a year left on this planet and finally the thinkers led by Jeffrey H Hinton The Godfather of AI also including Yan laon who we talked about earlier in this video Ilia suser the co-founder of open Ai and many others there are some omissions to this list that I found interesting it's interesting to me that Ahmad mustak from stability AI didn't make the list I also kind of find it a bummer that creators who are also sort of pointing people in the direction of a lot of the Innovations didn't make the list either but I can't complain about that too much but there definitely are people out there that are really helping push the AI narrative forward people like Robert scobble and Rowan Chung and Ben tossel and maybe I tossed myself in there as well we're trying to do our best to keep the public informed about where AI is going but again this is just the top 100 maybe we'd fall into the top 200 who knows anyway that's all I got for you today I really appreciate you if you haven't already check out futur tools. where I curate all the coolest AI tools that I come across I keep the AI news up to date on a daily basis I'm adding new tools every single day added 12 tools in the last 24 hours that's a little too much for you make sure you join the free newsletter and once or twice a week I'll send you an update with all the latest news that you need to know just the coolest tools I've come across and a few YouTube videos to make sure you keep coming back and watching more and once again thank you so much to cohesive for sponsoring this video I really appreciate it you make it possible for me to keep on making videos like this for a living so I really really appreciate you and thank you so much for watching if you like this kind of video maybe give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel I'd really appreciate it all right thanks again see you in the next one bye-bye [Music] I

Elon Musk's struggle for the future of AI: Elon Musk's concerns about uncontrolled AI and his efforts with OpenAI.



Elon Musk has been deeply concerned about the risks of uncontrolled AI and has been actively involved in addressing these concerns through his co-founding of OpenAI. He has had arguments with Larry Page about prioritizing human lives over potential consciousness of computers. Musk's goal is to make AI as safe as possible while also working towards human colonization of Mars as a backup plan. His struggle for the future of AI is highlighted in an article in Time Magazine, which delves into his history with AI and his efforts to shape its development.

of lagging behind in the AI world everything seems to be all about Microsoft and Google and open Ai and Elon Musk and all of that kind of stuff but according to reports apple is actually spending millions of dollars a day on training AI Apple actually believes that Ajax its most advanced language model is more powerful than chat GPT right now Apple's AI team has around 16 members including several former Google Engineers this all comes from an article from the information and they claim that a visual intelligence unit is developing an image generation model and another group is researching multimodal AI which can recognize and produce images or video as well as text now these are all just reports this isn't anything specifically announced by Apple but we definitely shouldn't count Apple out of the AI race they are definitely doing a ton of crazy AI stuff behind the scenes so this is pretty interesting it's actually called Amazon one and it's a tool where you it actually scans your hand and it can use it for payments and loyalty cards and entry access and various ways to identify you by your palm and they actually use generative AI to train this in fact they created a whole bunch of synthetic hands using Ai and trained it on these synthetic hands to help better recognize real hands and supposedly it's more accurate than scanning your retinas the idea being that in the future if you want to pay with credit cards you need to show identification you want to access entry to a concert or something like that you no longer need to scan your phone or a ticket you just wave your palm over a sensor and it knows that you're you and you're supposed to be there this week an article came out in Time Magazine all about Elon musk's struggle for the future of AI now it's quite a hefty read but basically it sort of breaks down elon's history with AI it talks about how he's been deeply concerned about about the risks of uncontrolled Ai and how he actually had arguments with Larry pagee who called him a species for wanting to Value lives of humans over potential consciousness of computers in 2015 Elon Musk co-founded open AI in order to go head-to-head with Google's dominance in the AI World basically Walter Isaacson the guy who wrote The Steve Jobs book is also now writing a book about Elon Musk and this article breaks down some of the story that Elon has about his relationship with AI and how Elon is feeling this increasing urge to try to make AI as safe as possible while at the same time get humans on Mars in case things go haywired also this weekend article is released on Fast Company about why Yan laon isn't buying the AI Doomer narrative if you're not familiar with Yan laon he is one of the Godfathers one of the early ogs of AI in this article he talks about how releasing these AI models to the public to get their hands on in sort of open- source models and things like that will actually help improve these models faster it was actually Lon who urged meta to start open sourcing a lot of their AI models yon laon Compares AI to the invention of the car you can have a car that rides 3 m an hour and crashes often which is what we currently have describing the latest generation of large language models or you can have a car that goes faster so it's scarier but it's got brakes and seat belts and airbags and emergency braking systems that detects obstacles so in many ways it's safer so basically he believes it's completely overblown large language models are prone to hallucinations and have no concept of how the world Works no capacity to plan and no ability to complete basic tasks that a 10-year-old could learn in a matter of minutes they have come nowhere close to achieving human or even animal intelligence he argues and there's little evidence at this point that they will and an even another hot take that came out well at the end of last week Mustafa sulliman the co-founder of inflection Ai and one of the original founders of Deep Mind had a lot

Yan Lao's perspective on AI: Yan Lao's belief that open-sourcing AI models can help improve them faster.



Yan Lao believes that open-sourcing AI models can help improve them faster. He compares AI to the invention of the car, stating that large language models are prone to hallucinations and have no concept of how the world works. He argues that they have not achieved human or animal intelligence and there is little evidence that they will. Lao believes that releasing AI models to the public and allowing them to be accessed and improved upon will lead to safer and more capable models.

Mustafa Sulliman's view on AI: Predictions of AI reshaping the world and eliminating white-collar jobs.



Mustafa Sulliman believes that AI is about to dramatically reshape the world. He argues that white-collar jobs, such as doctors, lawyers, accountants, and business VPs, will be eliminated by AI. He envisions a future where AI can handle tasks such as managing diaries, developing business strategies, designing drugs, and running hospitals. Sulliman suggests that humans need to rethink their roles and how they see labor and work in this changing landscape. He believes that AI will provide capabilities to everyone, from billionaires to street hustlers, and will enhance various aspects of society. Overall, Sulliman's view is that AI will bring about a significant transformation in the world.

there's been a handful of exciting things that have happened in the AI world this week so let's go ahead and break them down starting with the fact that X formerly known as Twitter updated their terms of service to include the ability to train any of your data on AI so they actually updated their terms of service under 2.1 operate improve and personalize our services to say we may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purpose outlined in this policy this article here on stack diary is making the prediction that it's some point Elon is planning on merging X Corp with xai Corp and using all of the data that it trained from Twitter in its new upcoming xai platform also this week Zoom rebranded what it was calling Zoom IQ they're now calling it The Zoom AI companion one of the most interesting things about this Zoom companion is that you'll be able to ask questions of it just like you do with chat GPT and it will reference all the conversations you've had in past Zoom conversations to answer your query in this chat says here users will be able to query the AI companion for the status of projects pulling on transcribed meetings chats whiteboards emails documents and even thirdparty apps they'll be able to ask the AI companion questions during a meeting to catch up on key points create and file support tickets and draft responses to inquiries as well as features that it was already able to do like have the AI companion summarized meetings automatically identifying action items and surfacing next steps Zoom even put out this video showing somebody asking question what has been discussed so far and the AI companion catches the person up as they join the zoom meeting so even if someone's late to the meeting they can still get caught up to date on everything that's been talked about that's something that we also recently saw Google talk about at their Cloud next event when they showed off that they were rolling out similar features with Google duet the video also showed off a handy chapters feature you can see down here at the bottom where you can jump to specific parts of the meeting a lot of these new Zoom features look pretty cool but as we've been seeing a lot of these other platforms like Google and Microsoft are also rolling out pretty much the exact same features inside of their competing products so it'll be interesting to see if Zoom can actually differentiate themselves and do something at least a little bit different from what we're starting to see Google and Microsoft roll out now probably the biggest news in the AI world this week was that the open- source Falcon 180b was launched making it the largest publicly available open-source large language model to date completely eclipsing LL 2's 70 billion parameters the capabilities of Falcon 180b sits somewhere between GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 so you're probably going to get better results and better output then you will with like the free version of chat GPT but not quite as good of results as what you'd see with something like GPT 4 inside of chat GPT it kind of Falls in between and across the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot

of lagging behind in the AI world everything seems to be all about Microsoft and Google and open Ai and Elon Musk and all of that kind of stuff but according to reports apple is actually spending millions of dollars a day on training AI Apple actually believes that Ajax its most advanced language model is more powerful than chat GPT right now Apple's AI team has around 16 members including several former Google Engineers this all comes from an article from the information and they claim that a visual intelligence unit is developing an image generation model and another group is researching multimodal AI which can recognize and produce images or video as well as text now these are all just reports this isn't anything specifically announced by Apple but we definitely shouldn't count Apple out of the AI race they are definitely doing a ton of crazy AI stuff behind the scenes so this is pretty interesting it's actually called Amazon one and it's a tool where you it actually scans your hand and it can use it for payments and loyalty cards and entry access and various ways to identify you by your palm and they actually use generative AI to train this in fact they created a whole bunch of synthetic hands using Ai and trained it on these synthetic hands to help better recognize real hands and supposedly it's more accurate than scanning your retinas the idea being that in the future if you want to pay with credit cards you need to show identification you want to access entry to a concert or something like that you no longer need to scan your phone or a ticket you just wave your palm over a sensor and it knows that you're you and you're supposed to be there this week an article came out in Time Magazine all about Elon musk's struggle for the future of AI now it's quite a hefty read but basically it sort of breaks down elon's history with AI it talks about how he's been deeply concerned about about the risks of uncontrolled Ai and how he actually had arguments with Larry pagee who called him a species for wanting to Value lives of humans over potential consciousness of computers in 2015 Elon Musk co-founded open AI in order to go head-to-head with Google's dominance in the AI World basically Walter Isaacson the guy who wrote The Steve Jobs book is also now writing a book about Elon Musk and this article breaks down some of the story that Elon has about his relationship with AI and how Elon is feeling this increasing urge to try to make AI as safe as possible while at the same time get humans on Mars in case things go haywired also this weekend article is released on Fast Company about why Yan laon isn't buying the AI Doomer narrative if you're not familiar with Yan laon he is one of the Godfathers one of the early ogs of AI in this article he talks about how releasing these AI models to the public to get their hands on in sort of open- source models and things like that will actually help improve these models faster it was actually Lon who urged meta to start open sourcing a lot of their AI models yon laon Compares AI to the invention of the car you can have a car that rides 3 m an hour and crashes often which is what we currently have describing the latest generation of large language models or you can have a car that goes faster so it's scarier but it's got brakes and seat belts and airbags and emergency braking systems that detects obstacles so in many ways it's safer so basically he believes it's completely overblown large language models are prone to hallucinations and have no concept of how the world Works no capacity to plan and no ability to complete basic tasks that a 10-year-old could learn in a matter of minutes they have come nowhere close to achieving human or even animal intelligence he argues and there's little evidence at this point that they will and an even another hot take that came out well at the end of last week Mustafa sulliman the co-founder of inflection Ai and one of the original founders of Deep Mind had a lot

Impact of cheaper power: Cheaper power will enhance various motivations, including commercial, religious, cultural, military, democratic, and authoritarian.



The proliferation of cheaper power, enabled by advancements in AI, will have a significant impact on various aspects of society. It will enhance motivations across different sectors, such as commercial, religious, cultural, military, democratic, and authoritarian. With access to cheaper power, individuals and organizations, from billionaires to street hustlers, will have the tools and capabilities to achieve their goals more effectively. This shift in power dynamics will reshape industries and prompt a reevaluation of traditional labor and work structures. The implications of this transformation are vast and require a fundamental rethink of how humans perceive their roles in the world.

Rethinking the role of humans and businesses: As technology can do tasks better, faster, and cheaper, the way humans see themselves as workers needs to change.



The article discusses the need to rethink the role of humans and businesses in light of advancing technology. As computers and technology become more capable of performing tasks better, faster, and cheaper than humans, it is necessary to reconsider the traditional notion of humans as the primary workers. The article suggests that AI will reshape the world by eliminating white-collar jobs such as doctors, lawyers, accountants, and business executives. It argues that AI will not only take over mundane tasks but also handle complex responsibilities like developing business strategies, designing drugs, and managing hospitals. The article emphasizes the need to adapt to this changing landscape and redefine the roles of humans in the workforce.

Different perspectives on AI: Elon Musk is scared and wants to fix things, Yan Laon believes concerns are overblown, and Mustafa Siman believes AI will dramatically change the world and require rethinking everything.



Elon Musk, Yan Laon, and Mustafa Siman have different perspectives on the future of AI. Musk is concerned about the risks and wants to address them, while Laon believes the concerns are exaggerated. Siman, on the other hand, believes that AI will bring about significant changes and require a rethinking of labor and work. These varying viewpoints highlight the complexity and uncertainty surrounding AI's impact on society.

Time's top 100 most influential people in AI: The list includes innovators, shapers, and thinkers in the AI field.



Time magazine recently released their list of the top 100 most influential people in AI. The list is divided into four categories: innovators, shapers, and thinkers. Some notable individuals mentioned include Elon Musk, Mustafa Sulliman, and Yan Lao. The list aims to recognize those who are making significant contributions to the field of AI. However, there are some omissions that some may find interesting, such as Ahmad Mustak from Stability AI. Overall, the list provides a comprehensive view of the key figures shaping the future of AI.

there's been a handful of exciting things that have happened in the AI world this week so let's go ahead and break them down starting with the fact that X formerly known as Twitter updated their terms of service to include the ability to train any of your data on AI so they actually updated their terms of service under 2.1 operate improve and personalize our services to say we may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purpose outlined in this policy this article here on stack diary is making the prediction that it's some point Elon is planning on merging X Corp with xai Corp and using all of the data that it trained from Twitter in its new upcoming xai platform also this week Zoom rebranded what it was calling Zoom IQ they're now calling it The Zoom AI companion one of the most interesting things about this Zoom companion is that you'll be able to ask questions of it just like you do with chat GPT and it will reference all the conversations you've had in past Zoom conversations to answer your query in this chat says here users will be able to query the AI companion for the status of projects pulling on transcribed meetings chats whiteboards emails documents and even thirdparty apps they'll be able to ask the AI companion questions during a meeting to catch up on key points create and file support tickets and draft responses to inquiries as well as features that it was already able to do like have the AI companion summarized meetings automatically identifying action items and surfacing next steps Zoom even put out this video showing somebody asking question what has been discussed so far and the AI companion catches the person up as they join the zoom meeting so even if someone's late to the meeting they can still get caught up to date on everything that's been talked about that's something that we also recently saw Google talk about at their Cloud next event when they showed off that they were rolling out similar features with Google duet the video also showed off a handy chapters feature you can see down here at the bottom where you can jump to specific parts of the meeting a lot of these new Zoom features look pretty cool but as we've been seeing a lot of these other platforms like Google and Microsoft are also rolling out pretty much the exact same features inside of their competing products so it'll be interesting to see if Zoom can actually differentiate themselves and do something at least a little bit different from what we're starting to see Google and Microsoft roll out now probably the biggest news in the AI world this week was that the open- source Falcon 180b was launched making it the largest publicly available open-source large language model to date completely eclipsing LL 2's 70 billion parameters the capabilities of Falcon 180b sits somewhere between GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 so you're probably going to get better results and better output then you will with like the free version of chat GPT but not quite as good of results as what you'd see with something like GPT 4 inside of chat GPT it kind of Falls in between and across the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot

generation of large language models or you can have a car that goes faster so it's scarier but it's got brakes and seat belts and airbags and emergency braking systems that detects obstacles so in many ways it's safer so basically he believes it's completely overblown large language models are prone to hallucinations and have no concept of how the world Works no capacity to plan and no ability to complete basic tasks that a 10-year-old could learn in a matter of minutes they have come nowhere close to achieving human or even animal intelligence he argues and there's little evidence at this point that they will and an even another hot take that came out well at the end of last week Mustafa sulliman the co-founder of inflection Ai and one of the original founders of Deep Mind had a lot to say about where he believes AI is going suan believes that AI is about to completely reshape the world this article literally starts off with the sentence we are about to see the greatest redistribution of power in history the article argues that a lot of the white collar jobs are going to be eliminated by Ai and he's talking about things like doctors lawyers accountants business VPS we're getting to a time where technology is able to do more and more things for humans to a point where humans being the workers is essentially got to be the old way these AIS will organize a retirement party and manage your diary they will develop and execute business strategies whilst designing new drugs to fight cancer they will plan and run hospitals or invasions just as much as they will answer your email building an airline or instead grounding the entire fleet each becomes more achievable whether it's commercial religious cultural or military Democratic or authoritarian every possible motivation you can think of can be dramatically enhanced by having cheaper power at your fingertips these tools will be available to everyone billionaires and Street Hustlers kids in India and pensioners in Beverly Hills a proliferation of not just technology but capability itself the argument here is essentially that the role of humans the role of businesses all needs to sort of be rethought because inevitably if computers and Technology can do it better faster cheaper safer all of that kind of stuff for us that's likely the route that humans are going to take and as we take that route and get further and fur further down that route the way we see ourselves humans as the workers the ones who do the things needs to change if you want to dive deeper into this article and its implications there's actually a great video here by David Shapiro I'll make sure it's linked up in the description it's about 10 minutes and he really really breaks down the implications and deep Dives on this specific article I highly recommend watching it it's definitely worth the time but that's three completely different takes on where AI is headed right right now Elon Musk who's scared and wants to fix things and wants to get us off this planet if possible Yan laon who believes all of this is overblown and everybody's just kind of worrying too much about where AI is going and Mustafa siman who believes that this is about to dramatically change the world not necessarily in the negative positive sense in the sense that we just need to rethink everything we need to rethink how we see labor and work and what the humans roles on the Planet are so three completely different thought processes around Ai and hard to say which one I sort of lead to I definitely think there's probably bits and pieces of all three of them that I could relate to so I just love going down these rabbit holes and hearing what others think about it and getting my own thought spinning on where this is all headed in my mind it's just fascinating the smartest people that are out there actually building this stuff the Elon Musk the Yan lacons the Mustafa Sans these people are all on the inside they're seeing this stuff being built they

of lagging behind in the AI world everything seems to be all about Microsoft and Google and open Ai and Elon Musk and all of that kind of stuff but according to reports apple is actually spending millions of dollars a day on training AI Apple actually believes that Ajax its most advanced language model is more powerful than chat GPT right now Apple's AI team has around 16 members including several former Google Engineers this all comes from an article from the information and they claim that a visual intelligence unit is developing an image generation model and another group is researching multimodal AI which can recognize and produce images or video as well as text now these are all just reports this isn't anything specifically announced by Apple but we definitely shouldn't count Apple out of the AI race they are definitely doing a ton of crazy AI stuff behind the scenes so this is pretty interesting it's actually called Amazon one and it's a tool where you it actually scans your hand and it can use it for payments and loyalty cards and entry access and various ways to identify you by your palm and they actually use generative AI to train this in fact they created a whole bunch of synthetic hands using Ai and trained it on these synthetic hands to help better recognize real hands and supposedly it's more accurate than scanning your retinas the idea being that in the future if you want to pay with credit cards you need to show identification you want to access entry to a concert or something like that you no longer need to scan your phone or a ticket you just wave your palm over a sensor and it knows that you're you and you're supposed to be there this week an article came out in Time Magazine all about Elon musk's struggle for the future of AI now it's quite a hefty read but basically it sort of breaks down elon's history with AI it talks about how he's been deeply concerned about about the risks of uncontrolled Ai and how he actually had arguments with Larry pagee who called him a species for wanting to Value lives of humans over potential consciousness of computers in 2015 Elon Musk co-founded open AI in order to go head-to-head with Google's dominance in the AI World basically Walter Isaacson the guy who wrote The Steve Jobs book is also now writing a book about Elon Musk and this article breaks down some of the story that Elon has about his relationship with AI and how Elon is feeling this increasing urge to try to make AI as safe as possible while at the same time get humans on Mars in case things go haywired also this weekend article is released on Fast Company about why Yan laon isn't buying the AI Doomer narrative if you're not familiar with Yan laon he is one of the Godfathers one of the early ogs of AI in this article he talks about how releasing these AI models to the public to get their hands on in sort of open- source models and things like that will actually help improve these models faster it was actually Lon who urged meta to start open sourcing a lot of their AI models yon laon Compares AI to the invention of the car you can have a car that rides 3 m an hour and crashes often which is what we currently have describing the latest generation of large language models or you can have a car that goes faster so it's scarier but it's got brakes and seat belts and airbags and emergency braking systems that detects obstacles so in many ways it's safer so basically he believes it's completely overblown large language models are prone to hallucinations and have no concept of how the world Works no capacity to plan and no ability to complete basic tasks that a 10-year-old could learn in a matter of minutes they have come nowhere close to achieving human or even animal intelligence he argues and there's little evidence at this point that they will and an even another hot take that came out well at the end of last week Mustafa sulliman the co-founder of inflection Ai and one of the original founders of Deep Mind had a lot

Omissions in the top 100 list: Notable omissions include Ahmad Mustak from Stability AI and creators who contribute to AI innovations.



The video mentions that there are some omissions in the top 100 list of influential people in AI. Notably, Ahmad Mustak from Stability AI and creators who contribute to AI innovations were not included in the list. The video also mentions individuals like Robert Scoble, Rowan Chung, and Ben Tossel who are actively pushing the AI narrative forward and keeping the public informed about AI advancements. However, despite these omissions, the video acknowledges that the top 100 list is subjective and there are many individuals contributing to the AI field.

related to Ai and new technologies let's see what happens if we use that exact same prompt here over on chat GPT paste that in there and it actually gave us a bunch of templates here dark blue futuristic AI the future Instagram post I click on check it out it opens up my canva and this post is right here inside of canva what it did was it found an existing template for me and it just opened that template for me in canva it was an exist exting one here's one called abstract artificial intelligence technologyfree logo not a bad looking logo but I have a feeling it's not unique and right there you can see it's already a pre-made template so this plugin is not actually building anything for us it's just essentially searching canva for existing templates based on what we asked for still pretty handy because sometimes searching through canva for the exact right template could be tedious so chat GPT just bringing the five most relevant to our attention actually kind of useful and speaking of AI they'll be hosting their first ever developer conference on November 6th if we take a peek here at the official announcement the developer conference will be in San Francisco and it'll bring hundreds of developers from around the world together with the team at openai to preview new tools and exchange ideas so that'll be really interesting cuz there could be some new announcements and new functionality of chat GPT that gets revealed during this event in this quick post on the open AI site Sam Alman said we're looking forward to showing our latest work to enable developers to to build new things now I'm not clear if Sam Elman or Greg Brockman or Ilia suser or any of the you know Big Wigs over at open AI are actually going to be in attendance but that would be pretty cool if they are if I wasn't going to be on a family vacation during that exact week I'd probably make the trip up next I want to tell you about the sponsor of today's video cohesive doso cohesive is an all-in-one text generation platform image generation platform and it even does text to speech with realistic voices and to make it even simpler than that they have tons and tons and tons of templates that you can use so you're not starting from scratch you don't need to be some crazy prompt engineer just pick a template like a transactional email or a legal memo generator or maybe you want to create a romance audio book they got it in here it took me forever to scroll to the bottom but when I finally got here some of the stuff that's hidden way down here menu prompt calls appointment reminder calls a subpoena generator but let's go ahead and use the one that I'm probably most likely to use myself here a script for a YouTube video it already already starts the prompt off for me here write a YouTube video script for a 5-minute history of artificial intelligence target audience Tech enthusiasts video length 5 minutes sounds about right I'm going to leave the reference links empty let's just see what it generates itself and click go it's doing the research for me it found a few YouTube videos so let's go ahead and click generate all right so now it's actually read the transcripts of those YouTube videos and is generating a unique script based on what it learned all right now we got a script hey there Tech enthusiasts welcome back to another exciting video on my channel in today's episode we're diving deep into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence why am I reading this myself Let's Have Sam read it instead hey there Tech enthusiasts welcome back to another exciting video on my channel in today's episode we're diving deep into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence not bad not only do I have a script for a YouTube video I could generate audio with all of this text turn it into an audio podcast and I can copy all of this text and turn it into a blog post look at this it even gave me example shots that I can add throughout this so shot of visualization of scientists at

about to dramatically change the world not necessarily in the negative positive sense in the sense that we just need to rethink everything we need to rethink how we see labor and work and what the humans roles on the Planet are so three completely different thought processes around Ai and hard to say which one I sort of lead to I definitely think there's probably bits and pieces of all three of them that I could relate to so I just love going down these rabbit holes and hearing what others think about it and getting my own thought spinning on where this is all headed in my mind it's just fascinating the smartest people that are out there actually building this stuff the Elon Musk the Yan lacons the Mustafa Sans these people are all on the inside they're seeing this stuff being built they know better than anybody else where this is heading and so to get three articles within one week of all of their thought processes of where this is right now it's just fascinating to me to sort of put them all together and have that sort of holistic view of where AI could potentially be heading and finally to wrap this video up Time released their top 100 most influential people in AI this week they broke it down into four categories they also picked tops of each category such as Dario and danello am modai I'm not sure if I pronounced that or not but they're the presidents of anthropic who we talked about earlier in this video of course Sam Alman deiss hassabis Elon Musk Jensen hang and Mustafa sulliman who we also just mentioned there's the innovators led by Ted Chang Shapers led by Alandra Nelson but also including Eric Schmidt from Google elaser yatkowski someone who literally believes that at the pace AI is going we have about a year left on this planet and finally the thinkers led by Jeffrey H Hinton The Godfather of AI also including Yan laon who we talked about earlier in this video Ilia suser the co-founder of open Ai and many others there are some omissions to this list that I found interesting it's interesting to me that Ahmad mustak from stability AI didn't make the list I also kind of find it a bummer that creators who are also sort of pointing people in the direction of a lot of the Innovations didn't make the list either but I can't complain about that too much but there definitely are people out there that are really helping push the AI narrative forward people like Robert scobble and Rowan Chung and Ben tossel and maybe I tossed myself in there as well we're trying to do our best to keep the public informed about where AI is going but again this is just the top 100 maybe we'd fall into the top 200 who knows anyway that's all I got for you today I really appreciate you if you haven't already check out futur tools. where I curate all the coolest AI tools that I come across I keep the AI news up to date on a daily basis I'm adding new tools every single day added 12 tools in the last 24 hours that's a little too much for you make sure you join the free newsletter and once or twice a week I'll send you an update with all the latest news that you need to know just the coolest tools I've come across and a few YouTube videos to make sure you keep coming back and watching more and once again thank you so much to cohesive for sponsoring this video I really appreciate it you make it possible for me to keep on making videos like this for a living so I really really appreciate you and thank you so much for watching if you like this kind of video maybe give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel I'd really appreciate it all right thanks again see you in the next one bye-bye [Music] I

there's been a handful of exciting things that have happened in the AI world this week so let's go ahead and break them down starting with the fact that X formerly known as Twitter updated their terms of service to include the ability to train any of your data on AI so they actually updated their terms of service under 2.1 operate improve and personalize our services to say we may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purpose outlined in this policy this article here on stack diary is making the prediction that it's some point Elon is planning on merging X Corp with xai Corp and using all of the data that it trained from Twitter in its new upcoming xai platform also this week Zoom rebranded what it was calling Zoom IQ they're now calling it The Zoom AI companion one of the most interesting things about this Zoom companion is that you'll be able to ask questions of it just like you do with chat GPT and it will reference all the conversations you've had in past Zoom conversations to answer your query in this chat says here users will be able to query the AI companion for the status of projects pulling on transcribed meetings chats whiteboards emails documents and even thirdparty apps they'll be able to ask the AI companion questions during a meeting to catch up on key points create and file support tickets and draft responses to inquiries as well as features that it was already able to do like have the AI companion summarized meetings automatically identifying action items and surfacing next steps Zoom even put out this video showing somebody asking question what has been discussed so far and the AI companion catches the person up as they join the zoom meeting so even if someone's late to the meeting they can still get caught up to date on everything that's been talked about that's something that we also recently saw Google talk about at their Cloud next event when they showed off that they were rolling out similar features with Google duet the video also showed off a handy chapters feature you can see down here at the bottom where you can jump to specific parts of the meeting a lot of these new Zoom features look pretty cool but as we've been seeing a lot of these other platforms like Google and Microsoft are also rolling out pretty much the exact same features inside of their competing products so it'll be interesting to see if Zoom can actually differentiate themselves and do something at least a little bit different from what we're starting to see Google and Microsoft roll out now probably the biggest news in the AI world this week was that the open- source Falcon 180b was launched making it the largest publicly available open-source large language model to date completely eclipsing LL 2's 70 billion parameters the capabilities of Falcon 180b sits somewhere between GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 so you're probably going to get better results and better output then you will with like the free version of chat GPT but not quite as good of results as what you'd see with something like GPT 4 inside of chat GPT it kind of Falls in between and across the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot

related to Ai and new technologies let's see what happens if we use that exact same prompt here over on chat GPT paste that in there and it actually gave us a bunch of templates here dark blue futuristic AI the future Instagram post I click on check it out it opens up my canva and this post is right here inside of canva what it did was it found an existing template for me and it just opened that template for me in canva it was an exist exting one here's one called abstract artificial intelligence technologyfree logo not a bad looking logo but I have a feeling it's not unique and right there you can see it's already a pre-made template so this plugin is not actually building anything for us it's just essentially searching canva for existing templates based on what we asked for still pretty handy because sometimes searching through canva for the exact right template could be tedious so chat GPT just bringing the five most relevant to our attention actually kind of useful and speaking of AI they'll be hosting their first ever developer conference on November 6th if we take a peek here at the official announcement the developer conference will be in San Francisco and it'll bring hundreds of developers from around the world together with the team at openai to preview new tools and exchange ideas so that'll be really interesting cuz there could be some new announcements and new functionality of chat GPT that gets revealed during this event in this quick post on the open AI site Sam Alman said we're looking forward to showing our latest work to enable developers to to build new things now I'm not clear if Sam Elman or Greg Brockman or Ilia suser or any of the you know Big Wigs over at open AI are actually going to be in attendance but that would be pretty cool if they are if I wasn't going to be on a family vacation during that exact week I'd probably make the trip up next I want to tell you about the sponsor of today's video cohesive doso cohesive is an all-in-one text generation platform image generation platform and it even does text to speech with realistic voices and to make it even simpler than that they have tons and tons and tons of templates that you can use so you're not starting from scratch you don't need to be some crazy prompt engineer just pick a template like a transactional email or a legal memo generator or maybe you want to create a romance audio book they got it in here it took me forever to scroll to the bottom but when I finally got here some of the stuff that's hidden way down here menu prompt calls appointment reminder calls a subpoena generator but let's go ahead and use the one that I'm probably most likely to use myself here a script for a YouTube video it already already starts the prompt off for me here write a YouTube video script for a 5-minute history of artificial intelligence target audience Tech enthusiasts video length 5 minutes sounds about right I'm going to leave the reference links empty let's just see what it generates itself and click go it's doing the research for me it found a few YouTube videos so let's go ahead and click generate all right so now it's actually read the transcripts of those YouTube videos and is generating a unique script based on what it learned all right now we got a script hey there Tech enthusiasts welcome back to another exciting video on my channel in today's episode we're diving deep into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence why am I reading this myself Let's Have Sam read it instead hey there Tech enthusiasts welcome back to another exciting video on my channel in today's episode we're diving deep into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence not bad not only do I have a script for a YouTube video I could generate audio with all of this text turn it into an audio podcast and I can copy all of this text and turn it into a blog post look at this it even gave me example shots that I can add throughout this so shot of visualization of scientists at
