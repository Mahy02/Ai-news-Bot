there's been a handful of exciting things that have happened in the AI world this week so let's go ahead and break them down starting with the fact that X formerly known as Twitter updated their terms of service to include the ability to train any of your data on AI so they actually updated their terms of service under 2.1 operate improve and personalize our services to say we may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purpose outlined in this policy this article here on stack diary is making the prediction that it's some point Elon is planning on merging X Corp with xai Corp and using all of the data that it trained from Twitter in its new upcoming xai platform also this week Zoom rebranded what it was calling Zoom IQ they're now calling it The Zoom AI companion one of the most interesting things about this Zoom companion is that you'll be able to ask questions of it just like you do with chat GPT and it will reference all the conversations you've had in past Zoom conversations to answer your query in this chat says here users will be able to query the AI companion for the status of projects pulling on transcribed meetings chats whiteboards emails documents and even thirdparty apps they'll be able to ask the AI companion questions during a meeting to catch up on key points create and file support tickets and draft responses to inquiries as well as features that it was already able to do like have the AI companion summarized meetings automatically identifying action items and surfacing next steps Zoom even put out this video showing somebody asking question what has been discussed so far and the AI companion catches the person up as they join the zoom meeting so even if someone's late to the meeting they can still get caught up to date on everything that's been talked about that's something that we also recently saw Google talk about at their Cloud next event when they showed off that they were rolling out similar features with Google duet the video also showed off a handy chapters feature you can see down here at the bottom where you can jump to specific parts of the meeting a lot of these new Zoom features look pretty cool but as we've been seeing a lot of these other platforms like Google and Microsoft are also rolling out pretty much the exact same features inside of their competing products so it'll be interesting to see if Zoom can actually differentiate themselves and do something at least a little bit different from what we're starting to see Google and Microsoft roll out now probably the biggest news in the AI world this week was that the open- source Falcon 180b was launched making it the largest publicly available open-source large language model to date completely eclipsing LL 2's 70 billion parameters the capabilities of Falcon 180b sits somewhere between GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 so you're probably going to get better results and better output then you will with like the free version of chat GPT but not quite as good of results as what you'd see with something like GPT 4 inside of chat GPT it kind of Falls in between and across the benchmarking test that was done with Falcon 7db it actually outperformed Google's Palm in most scenarios and on the hugging face leaderboard Falcon 180b is the highest scoring openly released pre-trained large language model surpassing meta's llama 2 so it's really exciting to see a model this large and this powerful being open sourced so that anybody out there can build off of it and iterate off of it and anybody anybody can go and use it and play around with it right now because it's available on hugging face you can go use the Falcon 180b demo I'll make sure it's linked Below in the description but you would use it just like any other chatbot now I'm not going to get too deep into it in this video I'll probably do a different video in the future where we break down this chatbot

Yan Lao's perspective on AI: Yan Lao's belief that open-sourcing AI models can help improve them faster.



Yan Lao believes that open-sourcing AI models can help improve them faster. He compares AI to the invention of the car, stating that large language models are prone to hallucinations and have no concept of how the world works. He argues that they have not achieved human or animal intelligence and there is little evidence that they will. Lao believes that releasing AI models to the public and allowing them to be accessed and improved upon will lead to safer and more capable models.

Time's top 100 most influential people in AI: The list includes innovators, shapers, and thinkers in the AI field.



Time magazine recently released their list of the top 100 most influential people in AI. The list is divided into four categories: innovators, shapers, and thinkers. Some notable individuals mentioned include Elon Musk, Mustafa Sulliman, and Yan Lao. The list aims to recognize those who are making significant contributions to the field of AI. However, there are some omissions that some may find interesting, such as Ahmad Mustak from Stability AI. Overall, the list provides a comprehensive view of the key figures shaping the future of AI.
