Researchers are exploring how AI can improve the accuracy and efficiency of climate models, allowing for better predictions and understanding of climate patterns. AI is also being used to optimize renewable energy systems, such as solar and wind power, to increase their efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, AI is being utilized in environmental monitoring to track and analyze data on air and water quality, deforestation, and wildlife conservation. MIT is actively researching and developing AI technologies to contribute to sustainability efforts and combat climate change.\n",
